## ALTERNATE VERSIONS OF LICENTIA

### It is generally recommended to play the version of Licentia available on the Wabbajack Gallery.

This is likely where you discovered the list, inside the _Wabbajack_ app under the **NSFW* checkbox for _Skyrim. This is usually the stablest, most-tested version, suitable for long playthroughs. I have multiple reports of saves lasting to 400 hours with over 3,000 collected _LOTD_ Displays. When in doubt, choose the UI version.

However, if you wish to indulge a different form of light **NSFW* gameplay, alternate versions of the list are available. You can find them all at _Licentia's_ home on **MEGA* [here](https://mega.nz/folder/RawGxSQC#18F3HuX5i5MvXzsMb6ARGg).

To install one of these files, you must extract them with an archive app such as _7zip_ or _WinRAR_ to a directory of your choice, then open the _Wabbajack_ app. Click the "Install From Disk" icon in the middle, and in the top box, browse to the location of the extracted `.wabbajack` file (such as `Licentia QUESTS.wabbajack`).
Ignore the `json` files, all they are is a list of all the mods for each Profile.

Below I will briefly describe each of the lists.

## ROOT directory of MEGA

### Licentia BLACK.7z

This is a backup version of the one on the Gallery, available in case something happens to the original. If you have already used _Wabbajack's_ Main Menu to download _Licentia,_ there is no purpose to this version. It is identical.

### Licentia MAX.7z

This is a massive, **700GB** profile featuring all of the available versions so far, with the exception of **EXPANSION.** You can swap between them from a dropdown so long as you choose a _New Game._ You can't continue from the starting room or anywhere else, it has to be a **FULLY NEW GAME** selected from the Main Menu. For information
on the Profiles within, continue reading.

### Parabellum.7z

This is a backup version of **PARABELLUM**, my **NSFW** _Fallout 4_ modlist, from the _Wabbajack_ Gallery. It is one of the earliest lists to feature **all three chapters** of _Sim Settlements 2_ and also distinguishes itself with attractive NPCs, curvaceous and muscular bodies, and a hotkey method to have immersive romance with whomever you want.

### Parabellum NUKA.7z

This is an alternate version of **PARABELLUM** almost entirely centered on the giant _Lover's Lab_ mod **NUKA RIDE.** You can read about it [here](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/18178-aaf-nuka-ride-a-porn-studio-mod/). There is little point to playing this Version unless you go straight into **NUKA RIDE.**

## "SUMMER VERSIONS" directory of MEGA

This directory contains alternate Versions of _Licentia_ based on _Licentia 9_ which was maintained in the Summer of 2023. They are abandoned and no longer supported, but you can still install them if you want, and I will try to help you if I can. They are all in the process of being revised to match the latest version.

### Licentia BLACK.7z

This is *Version 9** of _Licentia_ from a few weeks ago. Extremely similar to the one on the Gallery, so no real reason to install it.

### Licentia COMBAT.7z

This version of _Licentia_ is focused on 3rd person combat with the _MCO-ADXP_ mod by Distar. It is not recommended to play this version in first person. All the outfits have been replaced with revealing clothes, you can loot powerful sexy armors from boss chests, and there are extremely over-the-top slutty movement animations for the Player Character.

### Licentia DEAD.7z

This version of _Licentia_ is basically a vehicle for the _Serana Dead Sexy_ mod which you can read about [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73589). As an example of what it's all about, it has a grim, gothic horror look to everything which is slightly blurry and washed out, and from the start of the game you spawn with powerful two handed weapons that swing as fast as daggers and can 
explode people in one hit. You also quickly gain access to spells that can decapitate people, explode them, and turn them inside out. You have an at-will power that can summon a dozen powerful succubi who can do all these things as well as make love to you. Various sultry naked maidens are scattered across the landscape.

### Licentia NEEDS.7z

This is _Licentia 9_ as described above, but includes _Frostfall, Campfire, iNeed, Keep it Clean,_ and _Hunterborn_ for punishing survival gameplay. Everyone is in modest outfits.

### Licentia PITCH.7z

The _SexLab_ version of _Licentia._ It is based loosely around what _Masterstroke_ and _NEFARAM_ tried to do, only much more forgiving and without as many outrageous mods such as egg-laying and milk production. The primary focus is bondage and erotic roleplay for a female character who enslaves herself to a buyer who treats her like an object.
You can do all these things as a male as well, but some of the other available Quests and Mods may seem quite out of place.

### Licentia SAFE.7z

This is _Licentia BLACK 9_ as described above, but with all adult mods and nudity removed. There are no sex scenes, no nipples, and no junk. It is primarily intended to be played in mixed company or for streaming and promotional purposes.

### Licentia SLOOT.7z

_Licentia BLACK 9_ except everyone is wearing revealing outfits and you can loot endgame sexy gear from Boss Chests, just as in **COMBAT.**

### Licentia TOYS.7z

A much more stable and accessible bondage oriented version of the list which focuses around the _TOYS_ Family of Mods which you can read about [here](https://virginmarie1.wixsite.com/toys). The primary idea behind it was to be able to fight yourself up from being stripped naked and locked down tight with your powerful spells and abilities. Revealing outfits and sexy boss gear in chests.

## All of the above "SUMMER VERSIONS" are available in a more updated form in the "Licentia MAX" Profile mentioned Earlier.

Some of these may have **SLOOT** or **MINISLOOT** versions. For a **SLOOT** version, everyone is wearing revealing outfits, for a **MINISLOOT** version, everyone wears normal outfits, except you can loot sexy endgame gear from Boss Chests.

## "NEW! ALTERNATES" directory of MEGA

This is where current development of _Licentia_ is taking place. These are _HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL VERSIONS_ so it is _NOT_ recommended to try them unless you are bound and determined and willing to put up with potentially _EXTENSIVE_ bugs. That said, this is what they contain.

### Licentia QUESTS.7z

This version of _Licentia_ is updated to **10** and adds almost all of the _Hall of Forgotten_ Patches for _Legacy of the Dragonborn._ This mod creates a small portal in the _Dragonborn Museum_ which features hundreds more _LOTD_ Diplays. You can read about it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64117).

Under the dropdown you will find "Licentia QUESTS," which features normal outfits, "Licentia QUESTS w. lootable SLOOT" which features normal outfits but sexy endgame boss gear in chests, and "Licentia QUESTS w. SLOOTY REPLACERS" which has everyone wearing skimpy clothing.

There are also COMBAT versions of all of the above, with the third person focus of the previously mentioned **Licentia COMBAT.**

### Licentia EXPANSION.7z

This is basically _Licentia QUESTS_ packed out to the brim with thousands of more collectibles for _LOTD_. It is the most **UNSTABLE AND UNTESTED PROFILE.** Excpect problems if you play it.

All three methods of outfits are available (normal outfits, lootable sexy gear from boss chests, and everyone in skimpy outfits), but there is no **COMBAT** support.

## "OLD VERSIONS" directory of MEGA

### These are only backups for those lookihg for previous versions of the list.

The only purpose is Archival. **Do not install them unless you know what you're looking for.** Questions about them will be ignored.
