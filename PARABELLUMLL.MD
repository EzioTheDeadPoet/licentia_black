# READ ME!!! Extremely Important!!!

## The following guide should only be followed if you are attempting to install **PARABELLUM.** It is useless for all other versions.

### The Lover's Lab downloader is broken.

If you try to use the _Lover's Lab_ manual downloader in _Wabbajack,_ **I can almost guarantee it will not function properly.** It serves the wrong files, directs you to the wrong links, prints the wrong information in the logs and sometimes even writes the metas after download incorrectly. **As a result, you _MUST_ download _EVERY SINGLE FILE_ on this page** before closing this window. **TRIPLE CHECK IT, _especially if there has been a large update!!_**

## Advanced ANimation Framework

URL: https://www.moddingham.com/viewtopic.php?t=2

File: `AF_V171-0_beta.7z`

**NOTE:** This site is a little unusual in that it is not _Nexus_, and it is not _Lover's Lab_, and it still requires an account to access the files. _Advanced Animation Framework_ was removed from _Nexus_ and _Lover's Lab_, apparently due to disputes with those websites. 

**The AAF download will not be visible until you sign up and log in to this website.** You must create an account, confirm your email address, login, **and return to the URL above.** Be aware that the site is rather restrictive, so certain free email providers may be prevented from receiving the confirmation emails. Nothin' I can do.

You will find the file you need among the attachments on the first post in the thread.

## A FINAL WARNING

If for some reason you do forget a file and Wabbajack tries to download it and it fails, it will **never function again.** _You need to delete any failed files from the attempt from the downloads completely_ and start the process over again downloading and verifying each file. **It's a hassle but it's worth it.** If I have left something out of this readme feel free to ping me or DM me on Discord, I welcome interruptions.
