## I do not like SexLab, no sir.

Scenes take forever to start. Sometimes it bugs out. Most of the mods for it are badly designed. I don't even really want to offer this option.

But, it does have a ton of options for roleplay. It's popular. It's sexy. And several of my most dedicated users prefer it.

If you insist on using the _PITCH_ or _DEAD_ profiles, please be aware that often times your "scenes" will not play, you will get stuck in them, sometimes you will be unable to move, you may be defeated and go into bleedout with no way to come out of it, and other really inexplicable bugs that seem to be different for each person that experiences them. If this doesn't bother you and you **STILL** want to mess around with _PITCH_ or _DEAD_, you are going to have to perform the following instructions carefully.

Begin this document just after Character Creation with _RaceMenu._

**TOUCH NOTHING.** The next handful of minutes are some of the most massively scripted portions of the entire game on almost any modlist. **Wait for all messages to appear and disappear in the upper left corner.**

Now save and reload your game. **Again wait for any messages to appear and disappear.**

Open the menu and select **MCM Configuration.** Find the _SexLab MCM_ and click the option which reads "Install/Update SexLab." Then close the menu.

**Wait for for all messages to appear and disappear.** It takes about two minutes. It should say something like "Installed" a couple of times.

Save and reload your game and **wait for the messages.**

Open the MCM and find the _ZAZ_ entry at the bottom. Select the "SexLab" option on the left. Scroll to the top and select "Register." The entry will gray out. **Touch nothing** until this menu reads "Registered." It takes about 30 seconds.

Close the menu. Save and reload your game. **Wait for the messages.**

Open the MCM and find the _SLAL Anim Loader_ entry. Click the "Enable all animations" option. Wait a couple seconds. Cllck the "Register all animations" option. **Now you are just going to have to sit here and wait for a long time.** The process of registering the animations takes about two minutes. (I warned you, didn't I?) You should receive a message that some 300+ animations are enabled if it completes successfully.

Close the menu. Save and reload your game. **Wait for the messages.**

Now you can actually run the _MCM Recordings._ Open the MCM again and find the _MCM Recorder_ entry. Click the option that says **"READ README THEN RUN ME FIRST."** Click OK. Close the menu. Click Run Recording. Wait. You may receive messages that certain options are unavailable or that you need to Exit the MCM. **Click OK on these and ignore them, they aren't important, options only available in other profiles will be skipped.** Finally you will receive a message that the MCM Recording played back successfully. Click OK. **Continue to wait until all messages appear and disappear in the upper left corner.**

Save and reload your game. **Wait for the messages.**

Open the MCM yet again and find the _MCM Recorder_ entry. Click the option "RUN ME SECOND." Do the same stuff you did for the first recording.

Save and reload your game. **Wait for the messages.**

The final step is to run the optional _FUTANARI_ MCM recording if you desire such content. This option gives every female in the game a random 10% chance to Get Equipped with _The Touch._ This includes the player. To force _The Touch_ for yourself, you will have to consult the SOS MCM. I don't feel it prudent to go into details here.

**Wait for all messages.** Save and reload your game. Now you can play.

Good luck and may your game-breaking bugs be few in number. 

**I will not answer questions about this profile because most of SexLab cannot be fixed.** If it doesn't work it's your problem. _Just leave me alone._
