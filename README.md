## Preamble

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content and you need to be of legal age in your country (most western countries: 18+, some eastern ones: 21+)**.

_Licentia BLACK_ grew from a desire to solve outsanding bugs with the original modlist, _Licentia CLASSIC:_. The performance target for the list has been vastly reduced. The vast majority of the old gameplay from _Licentia Classic_ is here, with an emphasis to expanding _Legacy of the Dragonborn_-associated content. Many of the instructions from the _Licentia Classic_ readme still apply, if you find yourself struggling, please consult that document available [here](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS/blob/master/README.md).

### System Specs

Configurable. Keep reading or crash. It's your world, I'm just writing READMEs in it.

## Installation

###  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

I doubt you need to do this since you likely already have this installed. The package is required for MO2 and you can download it from Microsoft. Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Direct link</a> if you can't find it.

###  Steam Config

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

To ensure that _Steam_ does not automatically update _Skyrim_ for you and lock you out of playing your _Wabbajack_ modlist(s), head over to the Properties window, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the _Steam Cloud_ while you're at it.

**Set the Game language to English**

Wabbajack will check your game files and make sure that we have the same version. This also means that any other language than English will fail the installation.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the Language tab and select English from the dropdown menu.

**Install Skyrim** 

The _Anniversary Edition_ upgrade is required. No exceptions will be made. If you do not have the game installed, do so and launch the vanilla game to download all _Creation Club_ content available with the upgrade.

**Do Not Use Any Part of This List in a Protected Folder**

This includes `Program Files,` `Downloads`, `Documents`, the `Desktop` or any other folders that Windows considers "Protected" (essential to the operating system). If the _Wabbajack_ folder, the _Skyrim Special Edition_ folder, the _Steam_ folder, the modlist folder or the downloads folder are in any of these directories, the modlist will not function properly. Relocate offending folders to a non-Protected location such as the root directory of one of your drives. (D:\ for example.) _Google_ can assist you with accomplishing this.

**Do Not Use Any Protected Folders inside of OneDrive**

You will experience tons of weird bugs if your `My Games` folder (usually in the `Documents` folder) is part of a _OneDrive_ Cloud Folder. You will need to relocate it or disable _OneDrive._ There are no exceptions.

**Disable or Uninstall Offensive Anti-Malware Programs**

Exclude antivirus and anti-malware programs from monitoring three directories: those containing the _Wabbajack_ app, the _Skyrim Special Edition_ game folder, and the directory in which you wish to install the modlist. _Wabbajack_ and _Mod Organizer_ 2 both use low-level file system virtualization which most anti-malware programs falsely detect as malicious. 

Particularly intrusive malware solutions such as _Bitdefender_ and _Webroot_ don't propery respect exclusions, they must be completely uninstalled. Please consider avoiding third-party anti-malware solutions and relying on _Windows Defender,_ which is more compatible with the applications used to install and play _Wabbajack_ modlists. It is more than sufficient for legitimate Internet activity.

**Set Pagefile to 40GB Or Above**

This can be accomplished in the System Settings for Windows. Refer to _Google_ for assistance. It is recommended to set the minimum and maximum pagefile size to `40,960` all on one solid state drive as mentioned above. You do not need more than one of these.

**Ensure You Have Enough Space**

As of this writing you need approximately **20GB** for the `Steam` folder, **180 GB** for the downloads folder, and **200GB** for the modlist folder. These do not all need to be on the same drive. You also need **30GB** of free space on your `Windows` drive and **30GB** additional free space on your `Wabbajack` drive to leave room for temporary files, patches, and caches. Finally, never reduce the free space on any drive below **15%** (the bar in _File Manager_ will turn red) or you will suffer severe performance problems.
 
##  Using Wabbajack

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. 

It is advised to have ALL relevant folders (for `Wabbajack.exe`, `Steam`, the modlist folder, and the downloads folder) on a solid state (volatile) drive. Do not place any of these folders on a hard disk drive, flash drive, or external drive of any kind. After the list is installed, you can relocate **only** the downloads folder to such a drive (or delete it, but that may make updating difficult).

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you lose no progress.

**DO NOT CONTACT MOD AUTHORS DIRECTLY.**

I, cacophony, fully accept any responsibility for difficulties with this list and any conflicts I introduce, so please do not question mod authors on the _Nexus_, _Lover's Lab_, _Vector Plexus_ or any other site about bugs that may result from this lists' use. Direct your questions to me, not the innocent mod authors who should never be expected to support a modlist setup.

**Various files beginning with "cc" and ending with "esl" or "esm" failed to download.**

You did not purchase the $20 upgrade to Skyrim. This is not negotiable. Purchase it, verify it, delete it and re-download it if necessary, and try again.

**Could not download x:**

Some Internet providers have difficulty accessing the servers which host the files comprising the list. You might try using a VPN with a terminus set to the United States. Free options include _ProtonVPN_ and _Cloudflare WARP._ If a download gets interrupted, you may need to delete all corrupt local copies before trying again.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

_Licentia_ will not work with a GOG or pirated version of the game. If you own the game on _Steam,_ go back to the Installation step. If this still doesn't work, ensure that you are not running Wabbajack as an Administrator. DO NOT ASK FOR HELP WITH PIRATED GAMES ON THE WABBAJACK DISCORD.

**MEGA download cap exceeded.**

This shouldn't happen unless you download the list multiple times or download multiple Wabbajack lists. I can't support circumventing MEGA's bandwith restrictions so either sign up for an account or wait for the timeout to expire.

## Post-Installation

### Customizing the List for Your PC

To better target your system's capabilities, I have separated the ENB configuration into three profiles. You need to choose a configuration based on your system specifications, which can be determined with a tool such as `CPU-Z` or `Hwmonitor`. A little use of _Google_ will help you find out how your specific hardware relates to the below recommendations.

If you are on an extreme potato computer such as a laptop or a system with integrated Intel graphics, you need to find three mods in the left pane of _Mod Organizer 2_, "ENB Helper," "ENB Input Disabler" and "Improved Camera." Uncheck these mods before launching the game or you will crash.

If you are on a low end machine (older than 7-10 years) with any of the following:

- Intel i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 or earlier
- NVIDIA GTX 980 or AMD Vega 64 or earlier

You need to navigate to the "Stock Game" folder and copy all of the files inside the "enb low" directory into the base "Stock Game" folder, then launch the list.

If you are on a midrange machine (within 5 years) with newer hardware than the above but older than the following:

- Intel i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 or earlier
- NVIDIA GTX 2060 or AMD Radeon RX 580 or earlier

You need to navigate to the "Stock Game" folder and copy all of the files inside the "enb medium" directory into the base "Stock Game" folder, then launch the list.

If you are on a high-end machine with

- intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 5600 or later
- NVIDIA GTX 2070 SUPER or AMD Radeon 5700 XT or later

You need to navigate to the "Stock Game" folder and copy all of the files inside the "enb high" directory into the base "Stock Game" folder, then launch the list.

If you are on a beast rig with something like a 3090 or god forbid a 4090, a 5800x3D or 11900K or better, you will probably find more satisfaction out of a different Wabbajack modlist.

If you are confident you meet the requirements for one of the above targets, but still experience severe performance drops, you may need to customize your BIOS settings to maximize your hardware. Refer to your motherboard's documentation about enabling XMP or DOCP profiles.

### Launching the List

Launch _ModOrganizer.exe_ from the directory in which you installed the list. Launch the game from the **SKSE** entry in the drop-down menu.

# IF YOU RECEIVE A SWAPCHAIN ERROR WHEN YOU LAUNCH THE LIST, YOU DID NOT READ. READ!!

If you are interested in a profile with none of the adult mods and much fewer instances of nudity (along with no male nudity) select the "Licentia SAFE" profile from the dropdown above the list of mods before starting your game!

If you are interested in the stablest version of the list featuring the _OSuite_ series of adult mods, select the "Licentia BLACK" profile from the dropdown menu. 

The "Licentia KAIDAN" profile provides a fleshed out male romantic partner, Kaidan, courtesy of the _Kaidan EXPANDED_ series of mods from [https://kaidanmod.com](https://kaidanmod.com) in addition to Serana. Also available are expanded romance options such as _I'm Glad You're Here, A Skyrim Kiss_ and _Destination Weddings._ 

For the more horny degenerates, I also offer the _Licentia PITCH_ profile which emphasizes the most reliable SexLab quests available on Lover's Lab, along with plenty of Coom. Join my Discord and check #list-updates for further information on these profiles if you are interested in them.

# FOR A LIST OF ALL MANUALLY DOWNLOADED MODS, READ LLGUIDE.md ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPO! READ!!

## MCM CONFIGURATION

## WHEN YOU SPAWN IN HELGEN'S INN, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING!

Wait until the _Fertility Mode_ question appears on your screen. 

Choose whether to enable pregnancy and reproductive cycle issues by answering yes or no. Keep in mind that the overhead for this mod can be demanding for weak CPUs. Unless you have role-playing plans involving these features I recommend disabling it or minimizing its impact.

If you answer this question with _YES_, open your Mod Configuration Menu and find the entry for _Fertility Mode._ It is important to limit the scope of the mod if you intend a long-term playthrough.

## Diverse Dragons Encounters

Open the _Diverse Dragons Encounters MCM_ (DDC) and under the "Dragons" entry, **UNCHECK** the following:

O Nether

O Sanguine

O Vile

These dragons feature passive buffs and alternate attacks that make them almost impossible to kill. Of course, you can become near-godlike depending on your _Vokriinator Black_ build, so feel free to leave them enabled if you think you can take it.

## Nether Follower Framework

For immersive follower management, including the need to pay their weekly salaries, choose to "Import File" under the _System_ menu. This is not necessary for hiring requirements from the original game. You should probably at least check "Only Sandbox in Town" under _Activity_ to prevent them from wandering off in dangerous areas.

## VioLens

Go to the "Profiles" section and "Load" a profile. "Sane Violence" enables killmoves on the last enemy in combat. "Ultra-Violence" enables kill moves on every kill and unlocks decapitations from the beginning of the game. They both disable killmoves on the player.

## MCM Recorder

You should only run **ONE** of these! (Please choose at least one, each configures a baseline setup that is recommended for this modlist.) 

O I want it fun!

O I want it immersive.

Then close the MCM Menu, **TOUCH NOTHING**, and click the "Run Recording" button when it appears. Wait for all messages to stop and a message to pop up saying playback is finished. 

You might have noticed there are several other options here. You can run as many of them additionally as you wish.

"I want it hard as FUCK!" vastly increases the difficulty of dragon and modded encounters as well as adds up to 40 - 80 additional enemies in every dungeon or zone. 

 "I want it slutty!" makes it so that NPCs are more responsive to your advances, enables your clothes being knocked off during combat, and increases the frequency that you get exploited in other ways rather than killed. 

"FUTA" (the "BRUH" option) configures a female character to be a "futanari" (female looking character with a penis) and sets a small chance for any given female NPC to also be a futanari. Ignore errors about any missing menu options, you will receive such errors if you are male.

"NO FUTA" (the "BRO" option) disables all futanari from the game.

## FINAL NOTES

When you reach your first exterior, you will be prompted to enable _Survival Mode_. It is recommended for playthroughs using the immersive setting, and not recommended otherwise. Even with it enabled, you can still use fast travel by consulting the _Conner's Survival Mode_ MCM. You will also receive a prompted about which deity you wish to worship, depending on your race. Choose according to your preference.

## Updating the Modlist

Many times newer versions of _Licentia_ will require an updated version of _Wabbajack_. Please ensure that you run _only_ the `Wabbajack.exe` located in the root of the _Wabbajack_ directory. _Wabbajack_ will automatically update to the latest version if necessary. 

Download the modlist from the Gallery and specify the same directories. Then check the "Overwrite" box. 

It is rarely recommended to continue a save when you update a modlist.

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _Licentia BLACK_ folder.
