# Preamble

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content and you need to be of legal age in your country (most western countries: 18+, some eastern ones: 21+)**.

_Licentia BLACK_ grew from a desire to solve one incredible problem with _Licentia CLASSIC:_ the tendency for OStim's adult scenes to fail to complete on longer-term saves. To that end, the performance target for the list has been vastly reduced, making it a 60fps affair in even the most demanding outdoor areas even on low-end machines, especially with tweaks to ENB. The vast majority of the old gameplay from _Licentia Classic_ is here, but with less emphasis on troublesomely patched and maintained mods and more emphasis on things to do, see, and loot: more quests, more NPCs, and more collectibles.

This readme is a bit bare bones until more testing and user reports come in. If at any point you get confused, please refer to the _Licentia Classic_ readme available [here](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/LeS).

## Requirements

- [Nexus Premium Account](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/store/category/1-premium-membership/)
- [LoversLab Account](https://www.loverslab.com/)

### System Specs

My best estimate as to what you need to play _Licentia_ enjoyably is as follows:

- CPU: >= 7th gen Intel, OR >= AMD Ryzen 3000 series
- GPU: >= NVIDIA RTX 1080, OR >= AMD 5700XT; please keep in mind that AMD cards tend to have problems with ENB and are not recommended
- RAM: >= At least 8GB
- PAGEFILE: >= At least 20GB


- [Immersive & Adult on Nexus Next](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/xxsqm4)

Speaking of which, everything should be installed on an SSD that has at least 200GB of space available. The game is unplayable on an HDD, although you can relocate your downloads folder to one if you need space.

Please note that you will also require _at least_ an additional 30GB on the drive you installed Wabbajack.exe to for extraction and recompression of files.

## Installation

##  Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to **Updating**  in the **Troubleshooting** section.

###  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

I doubt you need to do this since you likely already have this installed. The package is required for MO2 and you can download it from Microsoft. Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Direct link</a> if you can't find it.

###  Steam Config

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

SSE is still being updated by Bethesda (they only add Creation Club content). Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically update the game for you and lock you out of playing your _Wabbajack_ modlist(s), head over to the Properties window, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the _Steam Cloud_ while you're at it.

**Set the Game language to English**

Wabbajack will check your game files and make sure that we have the same version. This also means that any other language than English will fail the installation.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the Language tab and select English from the dropdown menu.

**Install Skyrim** 

Here is a step-by-step breakdown.

1. First purchase the _Skyrim Anniversary Edition_ Upgrade from Steam. It retails for about $20.00 USD (varies between territories.) There is no way around this. I will not make a version specifically for you, so do not ask. All complaints about this will be ignored.
2. Install the game via Steam using the typical process.
3. If you are already confident you have the _Anniversary Edition_ of Skyrim, please do the following steps anyway. I wish to make certain, because _this is the most common question asked in my support channels._
4. To verify your version of Skyrim, first ensure that your game is set to English. No other version of Skyrim will work. There are no exceptions.
5. In your Steam Library, right-click on the menu entry for Skyrim, select "Properties" and then select "Local Files." Click "Verify Integrity of Game Files" and wait.
6. You may receive an error that files need to be downloaded again. Wait for this process to complete.
7. If not, Steam will tell you that all files have been successfully validated. You are ready to continue ONLY if you receive this message. If you did not, repeat the above steps.
8. Next launch the game once from Steam. You may receive a prompt that your settings were detected or not detected. You may not. It does not matter, nor do any options you select here. Simply open the launcher, click through any messages, and launch the game from the launcher.
9. As soon as the intro logos finish displaying and the Skyrim logo appears, you should receive a prompt to "Download All Content?" Accept this option.
10. If you did not receive a prompt to download, select the _Creation Club_ option from the menu, and you should find a "Download All" prompt in there somewhere. If this message does not appear, you have not purchased the $20 Upgrade. Begin again from step 1.
11. Wait for the download process to complete. It takes about 20 - 30 minutes. You cannot Alt-Tab out of this process, you must wait.
12. You are now ready to continue.

**Disable or Uninstall Offensive Anti-Malware Programs**

It is recommended that you **exclude** three directories completely from any antivirus or anti-malware programs you may have on your system. These include the folder that _Wabbajack_ is installed to, the _Steam_ folder that _Skyrim Special Edition_ is installed to, **as well as** all directories in which you wish to install a list. _Please note that certain AV programs_ (_Bitdefender_ and _Webroot_ being the primary examples) _**do not completely exclude a folder or disable themselves when told to do so.**_ When in doubt, _rely only on Windows Defender_ for your anti-malware solution. It is free, 95% as effective as any other similar package you might find (the best AV has only a 40% detection rate), and if you are regularly visiting websites where malware is a risk, you are likely compromised anyway.

##  Using Wabbajack

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. 

    Adjust the Installation Location to a directory located on the root directory of one of your drives
    For example, this might be "C:\Licentia", "D:\Licentia", or "E:\Licentia"
    Ensure the Download Location is where you wish it to be, it defaults to a location within the directory just above
    Click the Go/Begin button

To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have ALL of the folders (for `Wabbajack.exe`, the modlist folder, and the downloads folder) on an SSD. 

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you lose no progress.

**DO NOT CONTACT MOD AUTHORS DIRECTLY.**

I, cacophony, fully accept any responsibility for difficulties with this list and any conflicts I introduce, so please do not question mod authors on the _Nexus_, _Lover's Lab_, _Vector Plexus_ or any other site about bugs that may result from this lists' use. Direct your questions to me, not the innocent mod authors who should never be expected to support a modlist setup.

**Various files beginning with "cc" and ending with "esl" or "esm" failed to download.**

You did not purchase the $20 upgrade to Skyrim. This is not negotiable. Return to the beginning of this document and do everything again from square one.

**Problems downloading files from Lover's Lab or the Wabbajack CDN**

Lover's Lab files are obvious. CDN files have the word _Licentia_ in the filename. Refer to [this section] in TROUBLESHOOTING.md

**Could not download x:**

If a mod updated and the old files got deleted, it is impossible to download them. In this case just wait till the modlist receives an update.

**x is not a whitelisted download:**

This can happen when update the modlist receives an update. Check if a new update to the modlist is available and wait if there is none.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the Pre-Installation step. If this still doesn't work, ensure that you are not running Wabbajack as an Administrator. DO NOT ASK FOR HELP WITH PIRATED GAMES ON THE WABBAJACK DISCORD.

**All downloads from Lover's Lab are failing.**

Lover's Lab is much more restrictive about automated downloads to users outside of the United States. Attempt to use a free- or budget- VPN with a terminus in the United States to automate your downloads. I personally recommend Proton VPN from _MIT_, it's free, has decent performance and maintains excellent privacy protections. If you do not have such an option, you will need to download the LL mods manually, as per the manifest section below.

**MEGA download cap exceeded.**

This shouldn't happen unless you download the list multiple times or download multiple Wabbajack lists. Sometimes it does anyway. Try signing up for a MEGA account, or if you have already done so, try logging out of it and downloading anonymously (although much more slowly). I can't tell you to do it, but a VPN _has been known_ to circumvent some of **MEGA**'s restrictions.

**Wabbajack cannot continue because of unknown files.**

Move your downloads folder outside of your _Licentia Directory_, ensure the _Licentia Directory_ is clear of all files, then close and restart Wabbajack. Be sure to point the downloads box to your relocated downloads folder.

## Post-Installation

## Preparing the Game

The next step is to prepare the game for play. Navigate to the directory where you installed the modlist _Licentia_. Inside you will notice an executable file called _ModOrganizer.exe_. This file (the _Mod Organizer 2_ application) has already been automatically installed and configured by Wabbajack with all the necessary mods to run the modlist and does not need to be updated, replaced, or manually configured. Simply launch it to continue.

## Launching the Game

The rest must be completed after the game itself is launched. I recommend bringing up this readme on a portable device by navigating to [www.wabbajack.org](https://www.wabbajack.org) and referring to the Gallery. Anyway, Launch the modlist from the command which reads **SKSE**. If you receive a message that files are missing, do not exist, or a warning about an incorrect path, you _may_ have to edit the link to "skse_loader" in the drop down and point it to your Skyrim directory. Once you are in-game, create your character and follow _all_ of the instructions in the below link:

# MCM CONFIGURATION

# WHEN YOU SPAWN IN HELGEN'S INN, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING!

Wait until the _Fertility Mode_ question appears on your screen. You will give a simple answer: _YES_ I want to be able to impregnate or become pregnant, or _NO_, I do not. This tends to be a very demanding mod, so be careful with your answer! If you do not intend to roleplay with this mod, consider leaving it disabled completely (birthed children count as adoptions with respact to HearthFires content, and you can designate any interior location as a home for them or your spouse).

If you answer this question with _YES_, open your Mod Configuration Menu and find the entry for _Fertility Mode._

I recommend the following settings to reduce overhead with respect to the other scripted mods in the list:

## Settings Page 1

### Automation

#### Player Only

Checked.

#### Randomly Inseminate PC

Unchecked.

## Settings Page 2

### Preferences

#### Show Verbose Messages

Unchecked.

#### The Widget (ONLY IF FEMALE)

Unchecked.

## Diverse Dragons Encounters

After this a troublesome mod must be configured that may spawn dragons that are nearly impossible to kill given your other settings. Open the _Diverse Dragons Encounters MCM_ (DDC) and under the "Dragons" entry, **UNCHECK** the following:

O Nether

O Sanguine

O Vile

You can feel free to leave these on if you enjoy a challenge, but be warned that one of them has a near one-shot massive AOE attack and the other has far more regeneration that most characters are capable of attacking through. Especially if you adjust any of my difficulties higher!

## MCM Recorder

You're almost done. Thanks to a wonderful mod known as _MCM Recorder_ I no longer have to manually code MCM options for every setting each time a mod is updated, I can simply program a recording for you to run that does it for me. You should decide if you want a fun, easygoing, bloodthirsty game or one more intended for _Survival Mode_ (perhaps in concert with a _Bruma_ or _Chanterelle_ playthrough) where your abilities are less overwhelming, resources are more limited and higher maintenance is required. Pick the one that interests you:

O I want it fun!

O I want it immersive.

Then close the MCM Menu, **TOUCH NOTHING**, and click the "Run Recording" button when it appears. Wait for all messages to stop and a message to pop up saying playback is finished. Then you can continue enjoying the opening of the game!

You might have noticed there is another option here, "I want to use a controller." If you seek to play this modlist on a television, a portable device, or simply use the experience you have gained from a long history with consoles, I recommend joining my Discord server to find the best method to achieve this. Ignore this recording until you receive more specific instructions. (All it does is configure a few hotkeys to work with controllers instead.)

## ONE FINAL NOTE

When you first hit the overworld (or exit _Helgen Keep_) you will get several prompts. I recommend "Survival Mode" if you have chosen the "Immersive" set of MCM options and answering NO to the question if you have not. (Even if you do enable Survival Mode, there is now an option in _Conner's Survival Mode_ MCM where you can gain the roleplaying value of food and drink while still allowing Fast Travel.) 

Finally, you will get a popup about which faith you seek to follow as part of your backstory. Read your options and choose carefully. 

# THAT'S IT! ENJOY LICENTIA BLACK!

## Updating the Modlist

Many times newer versions of _Licentia_ will require an updated version of _Wabbajack_, otherwise you will receive an image of a knocked-out Sheo with the message "Corrupted Modlist." Therefore, please ensure that you run _only_ the `Wabbajack.exe` located in the root of your _Wabbajack_ directory, not any of the executables in the archives or version directories (such as _2.5.0.9_). When you do so, _Wabbajack_ will automatically update to the latest version if necessary. 

Then simply re-download the modlist from the Gallery and specify the same directories you did the first time. Then check the "Overwrite" box. This will _delete_ any customizations you have made to the modlist _unless_ you change the names of the folder(s) they are located in. More on this below.

It is rarely recommended to continue a save when you update a modlist because _Skyrim_ super doesn't like it when you do that. Only update on a current save if you wish to start the game over, or if there is some horrible bug with it. In the latter case, I can often write a patch to fix your problem without necessitating a new save. Ask me on my private server. Just to confirm, _none of your save games will be deleted_ when you update. 

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _Licentia_ folder and be done with it. SKSE and ENB files will still be in your game folder so I recommend using [ENB and ReShade Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4143) if you want to remove the ENB.
