## ALTERNATE VERSIONS OF LICENTIA

### It is generally recommended to play the version of Licentia available on the Wabbajack Gallery.

This is likely where you discovered the list, inside the _Wabbajack_ app under the **NSFW** checkbox for _Skyrim_. This is usually the stablest, most-tested version, suitable for long playthroughs. I have multiple reports of saves lasting to 400 hours with over 3,000 collected _LOTD_ Displays. When in doubt, choose the UI version.

However, if you wish to indulge a different form of **NSFW** gameplay, alternate versions of the list are available. You can find them all at _Licentia's_ home on **MEGA** [here](https://mega.nz/folder/RawGxSQC#18F3HuX5i5MvXzsMb6ARGg).

To install one of these files, you must extract them with an archive app such as _7zip_ or _WinRAR_ to a directory of your choice, then open the _Wabbajack_ app. Click the "Install From Disk" icon in the middle, and in the top box, browse to the location of the extracted `.wabbajack` file (such as `Licentia QUESTS.wabbajack`).

Ignore the `json` files, all they are is a list of all the mods for each Profile. Then you set your directories just as described in the Primary Readme.

Below I will briefly describe each of the lists.

### Licentia BLACK.7z

This is a backup version of the one on the Gallery, available in case something happens to the original. If you have already used _Wabbajack's_ Main Menu to download _Licentia,_ there is no purpose to this version. It is identical.

### Licentia QUESTS.7z

This version of _Licentia_ adds almost all of the _Hall of Forgotten_ Patches for _Legacy of the Dragonborn._ This mod creates a small portal in the _Dragonborn Museum_ which features hundreds more _LOTD_ Diplays. You can read about it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64117).

Under the dropdown you will find "Licentia QUESTS," which features normal outfits, "Licentia QUESTS w. lootable SLOOT" which features normal outfits but sexy endgame boss gear in chests, and "Licentia QUESTS w. SLOOTY REPLACERS" which has everyone wearing skimpy clothing.

There are also **COMBAT** versions of all of the above (focus on flashy 3rd person melee animations), with the third person focus of the previously mentioned **Licentia COMBAT.** 

Slightly larger **EXPANSION** Profiles are available which add a significant number of additional LOTD collectibles and a more fleshed-out _Hall of Forgotten._ 

The **PYJAMAS** Profile is a paid commission of EXPANSION which adds a limited number of _COCO_ armor sets that I am temporarily offering to the Public.

### SERVITIUM.7z

This is basically a different list due to a switch to _SexLab_ for the Adult Framework. The gameplay is based around getting locked down in BDSM gear and taken advantage of, but it is keyed to be a lot more forgiving than other modlist of the type. Limited creature content is available. Most of the difficulty and encounter mods have been removed for compatibility reasons, including _OBIS,_ _Deadly Dragons,_ _Genesis,_ among others.

**NEW!** Servitium TOYS is a better SERVITIUM. It uses the Toys and Love framework for a better scripted version of the BDSM approach and has more of a wacky "fun-loving LOTR porn parody feel" than most of SERVITIUM's "abandon all hope in my nerd dungeon you worthless thot" feel. You can read about this series of mods [on their website.](https://virginmarie1.wixsite.com/toys)

**NEW!** Servitium DEAD is a profile based on the _Serana Dead Sexy_ series of mods by @funguyscott. It's a schlock grindhouse bloody gore and vampire screwfest of doom. Play at your own risk. You can read about it more [here.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73589)

### ALL OTHER VERSIONS are no longer available due to the Skyrim Update.
